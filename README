This is a secondary homebrew exploit for Monster Hunter Generations.

There are some notable limitations for this exploit:
  * It only works on New 3DS systems. This is because game uses extended memory
    mode on Old 3DS systems.
  * It must be installed on the system you want to use it on. This is because
    the exploit uses the game's ExtData which is stored on the SD card, not the
    game cart.

Technical details can be found on the wiki:
